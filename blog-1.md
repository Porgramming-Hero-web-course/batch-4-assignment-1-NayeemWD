The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

--------********---------
In JavaScript, when we refer to any one of two or more values, this concept is represented in TypeScript as a union. We use a union to select between two or more types, which works similarly to the "or" operation. In TypeScript, we use the pipe (|) symbol to indicate that a value can be either one type or another.

An intersection type, on the other hand, is used to combine two or more types so that the resulting value must satisfy all included types. If we have multiple variables, arrays, objects, or classes that we need to use together, intersection types allow us to combine them. This is particularly useful when working with composite structures, such as objects with multiple properties, where different properties must coexist within a single type.
